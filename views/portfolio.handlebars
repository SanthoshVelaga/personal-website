                <p class="app-description">Was hired by client to create an MVP for
                a startup idea related to the food services/hospitality industry. App was built 
                using React, React-Redux, Chart.js, Firestore/Firebase, and Material-UI. 
                Progress was tracked with a trello board and bi-weekly standups were done on Monday
                and Friday. Purpose of the app was so that customers could leave reviews after eating at 
                a restaurant by scanning a QR code. If you want to try the app out scan the QR code above
                and go through the UX of leaving a review. There is also a business side to the app for restaurant
                owners to look at the reviews and analytics. For that click on the link to the project below and use the 
                following credentials: email: demoaccount@gmail.com / password: demoaccount2020.
