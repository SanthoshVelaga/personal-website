            Well fancy seeing you here! Since we're both here let me tell you how I got here.
            I am a self-taught software developer originally from the great state of Kentucky. Growing
            up I was originally on track to join the medical field, but somewhere along the way 
            I decided to switch into tech. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I moved to SF last year in 2018 to work in tech. While working in sales at a startup
            I took Cole Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp course online. I started coding everyday after work 
            and on weekends. After taking the course I started doing freelance work. I bring a high attention to detail
            given my past background in the medical field and a outside-of-the-box creative approach from
            playing music in bands growing up.
        </p>

        <p>
            I strive to improve at my craft everyday and use each new project as an opportunity to become
            better. To me writing code is a lot like music. In that sense I write code everyday in order to improve 
            everyday.
